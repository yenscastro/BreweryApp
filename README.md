# Web Development Project 5 - *Brewery App*

Submitted by: **Yens Castro**

This web app: **A modern React application for discovering breweries across the United States. Browse, search, and filter through breweries with an intuitive interface and real-time statistics.**

Time spent: **8-9** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X ] **The site has a dashboard displaying a list of data fetched using an API call**
  - The dashboard should display at least 10 unique items, one per row
  - The dashboard includes at least two features in each row
- [X] **`useEffect` React hook and `async`/`await` are used**
- [X] **The app dashboard includes at least three summary statistics about the data** 
  - The app dashboard includes at least three summary statistics about the data, such as:
    - **Total Breweries** - Displays the complete count of breweries loaded from the API
    - **States Covered** - Shows how many different states are represented in the current dataset
    - **Average per State** - Calculates the average number of breweries per state for geographical distribution insights
    - **Most Common State** - Identifies which state has the highest concentration of breweries in the dataset
- [ X] **A search bar allows the user to search for an item in the fetched data**
  - The search bar **correctly** filters items in the list, only displaying items matching the search query
  - The list of results dynamically updates as the user types into the search bar
- [ X] **An additional filter allows the user to restrict displayed items by specified categories**
  - The filter restricts items in the list using a **different attribute** than the search bar 
  - The filter **correctly** filters items in the list, only displaying items matching the filter attribute in the dashboard
  - The dashboard list dynamically updates as the user adjusts the filter

The following **optional** features are implemented:
